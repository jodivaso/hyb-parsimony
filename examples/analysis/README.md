# Comparative of HYBparsimony vs Bayesian Optimization and a three-step method based on Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection

[Comparative_3Methods.ipynb](Comparative_3Methods.ipynb) notebook presents the results of comparing HYB-PARSIMONY with two other methods: Bayesian Optimization (BO) utilizing all features (*num\_cols*) and a classical three-step methodology based on GA for feature selection (more info in the notebook).

To replicate results:

1. Download datasets from [openml.org](https://www.openml.org/) with [Download_Datasets.ipynb](Download_Datasets.ipynb) notebook.
2. Execute [HybComparative.py](HybComparative.py) to obtain results with HYB_PARSIMONY.
3. Execute [BOComparative.py](BOComparative.py) to obtain results with Bayesian Optimization.
4. Execute [SKGENETICSComparative.py](SKGENETICSComparative.py) to obtain results with HYB_PARSIMONY.
5. See results with [Comparative_3Methods.ipynb](Comparative_3Methods.ipynb) notebook.
