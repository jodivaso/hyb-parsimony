# Comparative of HYBparsimony vs Bayesian Optimization and method with Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithms

[Comparative_3Methods.ipynb](Comparative_3Methods.ipynb) notebook presents the results of comparing HYB-PARSIMONY with two other methods: Bayesian Optimization (BO) utilizing all features (*num\_cols*) and a classical three-step methodology based on GA for featuring selection:
